1,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,"Pulmonary Benefits of Cystic Fibrosis Neonatal ScreeningCF newborn screeningAlthough cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common, life-threatening autosomal recessive genetic disorder of the white population, there are often delays in diagnosis and hence start of treatment. Advances of the past two decades have made CF screening feasible using routinely collected neonatal blood specimens and measuring an enzyme level followed by CF mutation DNA analysis. Our overall goal of the study is to see if early diagnosis of CF through neonatal screening will be medically beneficial without major risks. ''Medically beneficial'' refers to better nutrition and/or pulmonary status, whereas '' risks'' include laboratory errors, miscommunication or misunderstanding, and adverse psychosocial consequences. Specific aims include assessment of the benefits, risks, costs, quality of life, and cognitive function associated with CF neonatal screening and a better understanding of the epidemiology of CF.

A comprehensive, randomized clinical trial emphasizing early diagnosis as the key variable has been underway since 1985. Nutritional status has been assessed using height and weight measurements and biochemical methods. The results have demonstrated significant benefits in the screened (early diagnosis) group. We are now focusing on the effect of early diagnosis of CF on pulmonary outcome. Pulmonary status is measured using chest radiographs, chest scans using high resolution computerized tomography, and pulmonary function tests. Other factors that we are looking at include risk factors for the acquisition of respiratory pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, quality of life and cognitive function of children with CF who underwent early versus delayed diagnosis, as well as the cost effectiveness of screening and the costs of diagnosis and treatment of CF throughout childhood.

If the questions underlying this study are answered favorably, it is likely that neonatal screening using a combination of enzyme level (immunoreactive trypsinogen) and DNA test will become the routine method for identifying new cases of CF not only in the State of Wisconsin, but throughout the country., Pulmonary Benefits of Cystic Fibrosis Neonatal ScreeningCF newborn screeningAlthough cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common, life-threatening autosomal recessive genetic disorder of the white population, there are often delays in diagnosis and hence start of treatment.

The improved life expectancy of patients with cystic fibrosis, as a result of advances in medical therapy, has resulted in an increasing prevalence of cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD). CFRD is associated with accelerated pulmonary decline and increased mortality. Pulmonary effects are seen some years before the diagnosis of CFRD implying that impaired glucose tolerance may be very early detrimental. Insulin treatment is clearly indicated in patients with CFRD to control symptoms and reduce complications. However, at the state of impaired glucose tolerance or fasting hyperglycaemia, current screening methods are not suitable for the early management of hyperglycaemia.The recent introduction of the continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS), which provides a continuous glucose profile, has revealed to be clinically relevant in the investigation of glucose excursions over a long period. This device, widely use in diabetic non cystic fibrosis patients, has been validated in non diabetic cystic fibrosis subjects. Previous studies of continuous glucose monitoring have been realized in CF patients with normal glucose tolerance and diabetes and compared with non CF controlThe aim of our study is to evaluate the glucose profile with continuous glucose monitoring the nutritional and respiratory status in cystic fibrosis subjects, according to their glucose tolerance., Metabolic Efficiency of Combined Pancreatic Islet and Lung Transplant for the Treatment of End-Stage Cystic Fibrosis : a Pilot StudyCombined pancreatic islet and lung transplantationPatients with end-stage cystic fibrosis (CF) and severe CF-related diabetes (CFRD) may benefit from combined lung-pancreatic islet transplantation. A recent case series showed that combined bilateral lung and pancreatic islet transplantation is a viable therapeutic option for patients with end-stage CF and CFRD. The use of different organs from a single donor may lead to reduced immunogenicity. As the prevalence of CFRD has increased dramatically with the improved life expectancy of patients with CF, islet transplantation should be considered at the end-stage CF. By restoring metabolic control, the investigators hypothesize that islet transplantation may improve the management of CF patients undergoing lung transplant and decrease the complication rate in the early postoperative period., Metabolic Efficiency of Combined Pancreatic Islet and Lung Transplant for the Treatment of End-Stage Cystic Fibrosis : a Pilot StudyCombined pancreatic islet and lung transplantationPatients with end-stage cystic fibrosis (CF) and severe CF-related diabetes (CFRD) may benefit from combined lung-pancreatic islet transplantation.

Mortality and morbidity are mostly related to the respiratory affection which appears early in neonates.

The constant improvement in symptomatic treatments and care strategies allowed CF patients' life expectancy to be increased over the last decades.

Vital prognostic is related to bronchopulmonary infections. 39% of CF patients under 18 years old and 70% of adult CF patients are chronically infected by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Mortality and morbidity are mostly related to the respiratory affection which appears early in neonates.

The constant improvement in symptomatic treatments and care strategies allowed CF patients' life expectancy to be increased over the last decades.

Vital prognostic is related to bronchopulmonary infections. 39% of CF patients under 18 years old and 70% of adult CF patients are chronically infected by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

41,41,41,41,41,41,41,303,"Phase II Prospective, Open Labeled, Multi-Center, Evaluation of the Safety and Tolerability of Nitric Oxide Given Intermittently Via Inhalation to Subjects With Cystic FibrosisNitric oxideCystic Fibrosis is defined as a genetic disorder affecting approximately 100,000 individuals worldwide. CF is caused by mutations in the CF Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene. CF patients are highly prone to environmental opportunistic bacterial infections leading to prolonged and chronic lung infections. This results in reduction in the life expectancy of CF patients due to excessive lung tissue destruction.

Nitric Oxide (NO) is a naturally produced antimicrobial agent which is part of the innate immune defense system of the lung. Both in vitro and in vivo studies had shown clearly that NO acts against a wide variety of microbes including drug resistant bacteria as well as viruses and fungi. Building on a successful phase I safety trial, the team aims to develop a combined drug-device strategy to combat lung infections caused by biofilm-forming bacteria. Unlike other inhaled drugs, NO is also a smooth muscle relaxant and avoids the concomitant bronchial constriction often associated with inhaled antibiotics. An added benefit of NO therapy is its mucolytic activity. We suggest that the combine broad spectrum antimicrobial activity, signaling and mucolytic properties of NO, delivered to the lungs of CF patients, will be directed at reducing bacterial resistance, microbial burden and biofilms as well as resulting in improved airway clearance of viscid sputum.

Primary Objectives: Assess the safety and the tolerability of NO intermittent inhalation treatment in ≥10 years old CF subjects. Secondary Objective: Assess the improvement in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) before and after NO intermittent inhalation. Up to 10 subjects with Cystic Fibrosis will be enrolled into the study.

Treatment administration: The subjects will receive intermittent inhalation of NO in addition to standard treatment for 10 working days (no NO treatment will be given to the subjects during weekend days). The subjects will be asked to attend the CF clinic once a week for a period of two weeks in order to evaluate the parameters related to the study. Oxygen (O2), NO, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) delivered to the patient will be continuously monitored., Phase II Prospective, Open Labeled, Multi-Center, Evaluation of the Safety and Tolerability of Nitric Oxide Given Intermittently Via Inhalation to Subjects With Cystic FibrosisNitric oxideCystic Fibrosis is defined as a genetic disorder affecting approximately 100,000 individuals worldwide.

Primary Objectives: Assess the safety and the tolerability of NO intermittent inhalation treatment in ≥10 years old CF subjects. Secondary Objective: Assess the improvement in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) before and after NO intermittent inhalation. Up to 10 subjects with Cystic Fibrosis will be enrolled into the study.

Treatment administration: The subjects will receive intermittent inhalation of NO in addition to standard treatment for 10 working days (no NO treatment will be given to the subjects during weekend days). The subjects will be asked to attend the CF clinic once a week for a period of two weeks in order to evaluate the parameters related to the study. Oxygen (O2), NO, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) delivered to the patient will be continuously monitored.","['Nitric oxide', 'Nitric oxide']",Nitric oxide,"1.

Trikafta (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor) is a combination CFTR modulator therapy that was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for people with CF who have at least one F508del mutation. The three drugs that make up Trikafta work together to allow many more chloride ions to move into and out of the cells, improving the balance of salt and water in the lungs. These changes result in better clearance of mucus from the lungs and improvements in lung function.

Inhaled hypertonic saline and Pulmozyme (dornase alfa) also improve clearance of mucus from the lungs to support lung function and have been available to people with CF for many years. Both therapies are considered to be relatively burdensome and it is not known whether either therapy can improve or maintain lung function above what is already gained through Trikafta use.

Studies imply that one problem might be that the patients are not compensated for the essential fatty acid deficiency (linoleic acid, LA), which is well known in these patients. This deficiency is shown not to be due to fat malabsorption, but related to an increased turnover of arachidonic acid, a transformation product of LA. This abnormality is related to mutations associated with a more severe clinical phenotype. The most common and typical symptom of LA deficiency is poor growth. Studies in animals have further indicated that many of the symptoms in CF are related to the deficiency. A series of recent prospective studies from Wisconsin corroborate the importance of LA for growth. In Sweden LA has been supplemented to most patients since the late 70´, and the condition of patients have been among the leading in the world regarding growth, pulmonary function and survival. Short-term studies have shown better effect of LA supplementation compared to similar supply of energy without including extra LA. There are few long-term studies, performed before the gene was identified, giving very heterogeneous patient groups in regard to genotype, but with some positive results on growth and physiology. It´s of interest that modern personalized extremely expensive therapy with correctors and potentiators for Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator may influence lipid metabolism.

This intervention provides a framework for a nationally generalizable model to improve best practices in generalist-level palliative care in CF.

Objectives:

Aim 1: Implement a primary palliative care intervention comprising screening-and-triage workflows, best practice treatment guides for high frequency problems, patient/family and provider education, and a quality improvement (QI) toolkit.

Aim 2: Evaluate feasibility, uptake, and preliminary outcomes during a multisite pragmatic, implementation trial of the intervention at 5 diverse Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Centers.

Subaim 2.1: Evaluate feasibility and uptake as measured by rates of screening and treatment delivery.

Hypothesis 1: Related to feasibility and uptake of the intervention:

> 80% of individuals with CF of all ages will receive an annual palliative care screening.
> 25% of individuals with CF will receive a palliative care screening prompted by hospitalization, new diagnosis of CF-Related Diabetes, need for transplantation, or another disease- or treatment-specific trigger.

Hypothesis 2: Related to provider education:

a) > 80% will access >1 training(s) (on-demand webinars or in-service by trained site educators).

Subaim 2.2: Evaluate data on preliminary outcomes for individuals with CF by comparing ratings on patient- and caregiver-reported outcome measures (e.g., Integrated Palliative Care Outcome Scale, Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised, Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale-Cystic Fibrosis, and Brief Assessment Scale for Caregivers) during the trial to baseline ratings and exploring covariates of change (age, race/ethnicity, gender, disease severity, CFTR modifier treatment, psychological distress, and varied indicators reflecting intervention implementation)., Pragmatic Implementation Trial of a CF Primary Palliative Care InterventionImplementation of Primary Palliative Care Intervention in CF CentersFive Cystic Fibrosis (CF) centers, key stakeholders, and a palliative care institute have collaborated to create a novel primary palliative care intervention for patients with CF, \Improving Life with CF: A Primary Palliative Care Partnership,\ and established the infrastructure and support necessary for a follow-on implementation study.

The goal of palliative care is to manage symptoms and provide emotional and spiritual support to patients and their families. Palliative care is not the same as end-of-life care, but it can be provided alongside curative treatment.

2. Implementation: This refers to the process of putting a plan, concept, or strategy into action. In the context of palliative care, implementation refers to the process of introducing a new palliative care intervention into a cystic fibrosis center. This involves planning, training, and coordinating the efforts of healthcare professionals, patients, and their families to ensure the successful integration of palliative care into the existing care model.

This has led to it being licensed for use in the UK in 2022 and is now being prescribed in this age group. There is little information in trials however that shows the effect KaftrioTM (ETI) has on the gut or liver in this age group.

Previous studies in the GIFT-CF series (NCT 03566550, NCT04006873 and NCT04618185) has found differences in the functioning of the gut between adults with CF and healthy controls but it is not known whether these differences are present in those aged 6 to 11 years.

This study is a significant amendment of the GIFT-CF3 protocol (NCT04618185) that aims to measure gut function using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in children with CF before and after starting ETI. This study also aims to opportunistically measure lung function and structure using MRI and explore how the liver can be measured using MRI in this age group.

The study is split into 2 stages. The first is a pilot stage using the modified GIFT-CF protocol recruiting 3 children with CF before starting ETI and 3 healthy volunteers. This is to determine we are able to successfully perform these scans in these age groups. If successful, the second stage will recruit a further 12 children with CF before they start ETI. This will take our cohort up to 15 children with CF. This cohort will then be rescanned 6 months after starting ETI using the same scan protocol., Gut Imaging for Function and Transit in Cystic Fibrosis 3 Junior: an Evaluation of Triple Combination Therapy in Children Aged 6 to 11 YearsElexacaftor / Ivacaftor / TezacaftorRecently trial data has shown that the medicine KaftrioTM (Elexacaftor/ Tezacaftor/ Ivacaftor) improves lung function in children aged 6 to 11 years who have cystic fibrosis (CF).

Previous studies in the GIFT-CF series (NCT 03566550, NCT04006873 and NCT04618185) has found differences in the functioning of the gut between adults with CF and healthy controls but it is not known whether these differences are present in those aged 6 to 11 years.

This study is a significant amendment of the GIFT-CF3 protocol (NCT04618185) that aims to measure gut function using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in children with CF before and after starting ETI. This study also aims to opportunistically measure lung function and structure using MRI and explore how the liver can be measured using MRI in this age group.

The study is split into 2 stages. The first is a pilot stage using the modified GIFT-CF protocol recruiting 3 children with CF before starting ETI and 3 healthy volunteers. This is to determine we are able to successfully perform these scans in these age groups. If successful, the second stage will recruit a further 12 children with CF before they start ETI. This will take our cohort up to 15 children with CF. This cohort will then be rescanned 6 months after starting ETI using the same scan protocol.","['Elexacaftor / Ivacaftor / Tezacaftor', 'Elexacaftor / Ivacaftor / Tezacaftor']",Elexacaftor / Ivacaftor / Tezacaftor,"1.
