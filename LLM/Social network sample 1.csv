0,5,"A Phase II Multicenter Randomized Trial of Tobramycin for Inhalation in Young Children With Cystic FibrosisTobramycin for InhalationThis study's primary goals are to test the safety and effectiveness of Tobramycin for Inhalation (TOBIr) in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients who are between 6 months and 6 years of age. This drug is an antibiotic that is inhaled into the lungs by the patient. It has already been studied and approved by the FDA for treatment of CF patients 6 years and older. Lung fluid will be examined for bacteria before and after the 28-day treatment. The amount of bacteria before and after treatment will be compared. This will indicate whether the antibiotic was effective in killing bacteria in the lungs. Once treatment begins, patients will be monitored every 2 weeks throughout the study (5 exams in 56 days). Half of the patients will receive TOBIr, half will receive a placebo (a substance that looks like TOBIr but contains no medication)., Effectiveness and Safety of Intermittent Antimicrobial Therapy for the Treatment of New Onset Pseudomonas Aeruginosa Airway Infection in Young Patients With Cystic FibrosisTobramycin solution for inhalation (TOBI), Oral placebo, Oral ciprofloxacinCystic fibrosis (CF) is a chronic disease that significantly affects an individual's lung function.

1,7,"Pulmonary Benefits of Cystic Fibrosis Neonatal ScreeningCF newborn screeningAlthough cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common, life-threatening autosomal recessive genetic disorder of the white population, there are often delays in diagnosis and hence start of treatment. Advances of the past two decades have made CF screening feasible using routinely collected neonatal blood specimens and measuring an enzyme level followed by CF mutation DNA analysis. Our overall goal of the study is to see if early diagnosis of CF through neonatal screening will be medically beneficial without major risks. ''Medically beneficial'' refers to better nutrition and/or pulmonary status, whereas '' risks'' include laboratory errors, miscommunication or misunderstanding, and adverse psychosocial consequences. Specific aims include assessment of the benefits, risks, costs, quality of life, and cognitive function associated with CF neonatal screening and a better understanding of the epidemiology of CF.

A comprehensive, randomized clinical trial emphasizing early diagnosis as the key variable has been underway since 1985. Nutritional status has been assessed using height and weight measurements and biochemical methods. The results have demonstrated significant benefits in the screened (early diagnosis) group. We are now focusing on the effect of early diagnosis of CF on pulmonary outcome. Pulmonary status is measured using chest radiographs, chest scans using high resolution computerized tomography, and pulmonary function tests. Other factors that we are looking at include risk factors for the acquisition of respiratory pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, quality of life and cognitive function of children with CF who underwent early versus delayed diagnosis, as well as the cost effectiveness of screening and the costs of diagnosis and treatment of CF throughout childhood.

If the questions underlying this study are answered favorably, it is likely that neonatal screening using a combination of enzyme level (immunoreactive trypsinogen) and DNA test will become the routine method for identifying new cases of CF not only in the State of Wisconsin, but throughout the country., Pulmonary Benefits of Cystic Fibrosis Neonatal ScreeningCF newborn screeningAlthough cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common, life-threatening autosomal recessive genetic disorder of the white population, there are often delays in diagnosis and hence start of treatment.

Some epidemiologic studies suggest possible worse outcomes, a recent analyses showing this with chronic but not intermittent MRSA. Given the chronic difficult to treat lung infections in CF it is unclear how the onset of MRSA should be approached. This randomized, controlled, interventional study seeks to determine if an early eradication protocol is effective for eradication of MRSA and will provide an opportunity to obtain data regarding early clinical impact of new isolation of MRSA.

Participants: Cystic fibrosis patients with new isolation of MRSA from their respiratory culture on a routine clinic visit.

Previous studies have demonstrated an improvement in lung function related to small airways obstruction and a significant improvement in respiratory symptoms and quality of life after a 2 week treatment with mannitol. This current study seeks to support these early findings and to extend the evidence to support its use as a mucoactive therapy in cystic fibrosis. In particular, the hypothesis that enhanced mucus clearance will improve the lung function and clinical presentation in this population, will be investigated. We also hypothesize that enhanced mucociliary clearance will result in a sustained reduction in mucus load, thus providing less opportunity for bacteria to proliferate, affording a reduction in antibiotic use and hospitalizations.

13,87,"Multicenter Prospective Study of Abnormalies Tolerance Glucose by the Continuous Measurement of Glucose of Nutritional Status and Breathing in the Patient With Cystic FibrosisContinuous Glucose Monitoring System (CGMS), Urinary collectDiabetes is a important complication of cystic fibrosis (CF). The improved life expectancy of patients with cystic fibrosis, as a result of advances in medical therapy, has resulted in an increasing prevalence of cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD). CFRD is associated with accelerated pulmonary decline and increased mortality. Pulmonary effects are seen some years before the diagnosis of CFRD implying that impaired glucose tolerance may be very early detrimental. Insulin treatment is clearly indicated in patients with CFRD to control symptoms and reduce complications. However, at the state of impaired glucose tolerance or fasting hyperglycaemia, current screening methods are not suitable for the early management of hyperglycaemia.The recent introduction of the continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS), which provides a continuous glucose profile, has revealed to be clinically relevant in the investigation of glucose excursions over a long period. This device, widely use in diabetic non cystic fibrosis patients, has been validated in non diabetic cystic fibrosis subjects. Previous studies of continuous glucose monitoring have been realized in CF patients with normal glucose tolerance and diabetes and compared with non CF controlThe aim of our study is to evaluate the glucose profile with continuous glucose monitoring the nutritional and respiratory status in cystic fibrosis subjects, according to their glucose tolerance., Metabolic Efficiency of Combined Pancreatic Islet and Lung Transplant for the Treatment of End-Stage Cystic Fibrosis : a Pilot StudyCombined pancreatic islet and lung transplantationPatients with end-stage cystic fibrosis (CF) and severe CF-related diabetes (CFRD) may benefit from combined lung-pancreatic islet transplantation. A recent case series showed that combined bilateral lung and pancreatic islet transplantation is a viable therapeutic option for patients with end-stage CF and CFRD. The use of different organs from a single donor may lead to reduced immunogenicity. As the prevalence of CFRD has increased dramatically with the improved life expectancy of patients with CF, islet transplantation should be considered at the end-stage CF. By restoring metabolic control, the investigators hypothesize that islet transplantation may improve the management of CF patients undergoing lung transplant and decrease the complication rate in the early postoperative period., Metabolic Efficiency of Combined Pancreatic Islet and Lung Transplant for the Treatment of End-Stage Cystic Fibrosis : a Pilot StudyCombined pancreatic islet and lung transplantationPatients with end-stage cystic fibrosis (CF) and severe CF-related diabetes (CFRD) may benefit from combined lung-pancreatic islet transplantation.

Mortality and morbidity are mostly related to the respiratory affection which appears early in neonates.

The constant improvement in symptomatic treatments and care strategies allowed CF patients' life expectancy to be increased over the last decades.

Vital prognostic is related to bronchopulmonary infections. 39% of CF patients under 18 years old and 70% of adult CF patients are chronically infected by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Elevated concentrations of tobramycin in broncho secretions, about 1000 times the MIC, is obtained by inhaled administration of tobramycin and is active against in-vitro resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Study hypotheses :

Regarding literature data and in-vitro studies, the administration of Nebcinal® 150mg/3ml administered twice a day by Aeroneb® Idehaler® pocket® would deliver the same quantity of antibiotic in lung and plasma as Tobi® 300mg/5ml administered twice a day by Pari® LC Plus® in children and adult patients with CF.

41,303,"Phase II Prospective, Open Labeled, Multi-Center, Evaluation of the Safety and Tolerability of Nitric Oxide Given Intermittently Via Inhalation to Subjects With Cystic FibrosisNitric oxideCystic Fibrosis is defined as a genetic disorder affecting approximately 100,000 individuals worldwide. CF is caused by mutations in the CF Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene. CF patients are highly prone to environmental opportunistic bacterial infections leading to prolonged and chronic lung infections. This results in reduction in the life expectancy of CF patients due to excessive lung tissue destruction.

Nitric Oxide (NO) is a naturally produced antimicrobial agent which is part of the innate immune defense system of the lung. Both in vitro and in vivo studies had shown clearly that NO acts against a wide variety of microbes including drug resistant bacteria as well as viruses and fungi. Building on a successful phase I safety trial, the team aims to develop a combined drug-device strategy to combat lung infections caused by biofilm-forming bacteria. Unlike other inhaled drugs, NO is also a smooth muscle relaxant and avoids the concomitant bronchial constriction often associated with inhaled antibiotics. An added benefit of NO therapy is its mucolytic activity. We suggest that the combine broad spectrum antimicrobial activity, signaling and mucolytic properties of NO, delivered to the lungs of CF patients, will be directed at reducing bacterial resistance, microbial burden and biofilms as well as resulting in improved airway clearance of viscid sputum.

Primary Objectives: Assess the safety and the tolerability of NO intermittent inhalation treatment in ≥10 years old CF subjects. Secondary Objective: Assess the improvement in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) before and after NO intermittent inhalation. Up to 10 subjects with Cystic Fibrosis will be enrolled into the study.

Treatment administration: The subjects will receive intermittent inhalation of NO in addition to standard treatment for 10 working days (no NO treatment will be given to the subjects during weekend days). The subjects will be asked to attend the CF clinic once a week for a period of two weeks in order to evaluate the parameters related to the study. Oxygen (O2), NO, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) delivered to the patient will be continuously monitored., Phase II Prospective, Open Labeled, Multi-Center, Evaluation of the Safety and Tolerability of Nitric Oxide Given Intermittently Via Inhalation to Subjects With Cystic FibrosisNitric oxideCystic Fibrosis is defined as a genetic disorder affecting approximately 100,000 individuals worldwide.

Primary Objectives: Assess the safety and the tolerability of NO intermittent inhalation treatment in ≥10 years old CF subjects. Secondary Objective: Assess the improvement in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) before and after NO intermittent inhalation. Up to 10 subjects with Cystic Fibrosis will be enrolled into the study.

Treatment administration: The subjects will receive intermittent inhalation of NO in addition to standard treatment for 10 working days (no NO treatment will be given to the subjects during weekend days). The subjects will be asked to attend the CF clinic once a week for a period of two weeks in order to evaluate the parameters related to the study. Oxygen (O2), NO, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) delivered to the patient will be continuously monitored.","['Nitric oxide', 'Nitric oxide']"

The vast majority of patients with CF will develop pancreatic endocrine insufficiency over time manifested as altered glucose metabolism. The presence of overt diabetes in patients with CF is associated with adverse clinical outcomes.

The underlying pathophysiology of cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) is still a matter of investigation. In addition to localized tissue damage developing similar to that of the exocrine pancreas, additional mechanisms may be involved. The investigators have recently shown that insulin secretion in patients with CF is significantly altered prior to the development of diabetes. This phenomenon is associated with reduced secretion of gut derived incretins (specifically GIP). The blunting of incretin induced insulin secretion (whether due to a deranged interaction of gastrointestinal contents with enterocytes resulting in reduced secretion or due to rapid clearance of such peptides) may be a major underlying driver of altered glucose metabolism in such patients., DPP-IV Inhibition in Patients With Cystic FibrosisSaxagliptinCystic Fibrosis (CF) is a chronic disease characterized by recurrent pulmonary infections and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.

This infection is now known to consist of free-living bacteria (known as \planktonic bacteria\) and bacteria in colonies on body surfaces known as \biofilms\. The bacteria in biofilms are more resistant and tolerant to antibiotics. Current CF treatment of exacerbations aims to eradicate or control pseudomonal infection using aggressive antibiotic regimes.

Despite this treatment many patients develop chronic infection which is never cleared. Chronic infection causes damage to the lungs. Patients colonised with Pseudomonas are more unwell and die at a younger age. Our laboratory has established that low dose nitric oxide (NO) can disrupt pseudomonal biofilms in the laboratory. This pilot study will discover whether non-toxic levels of NO administered to participants during an episode of acute infection (exacerbation) will disrupt bacteria from biofilms and increase the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy. This protocol describes a participant-blind randomised controlled pilot study of treatment with nitric oxide gas during an acute infective exacerbation (also known simply as an \acute exacerbation\).

They will be randomised to receive 7 days either of inhaled nitric oxide gas or placebo alongside standard therapy during an exacerbation.

68,646,"COVID-19 Antibody Responses In Cystic FibrosisBlood samplingCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which is caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in an ongoing global pandemic. It is unclear whether the relatively low number of reported cases of COVID-19 in people with CF (pwCF) is due to enhanced infection prevention practices or whether pwCF have protective genetic/immune factors. This study aims to prospectively assess the proportion of pwCF, including both adults and children with CF who have evidence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies over a two-year period. This study will also examine whether pwCF who have antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 have a different clinical presentation and what impact this has on their CF disease. The proposed study will recruit pwCF from paediatric and adult CF centres in Europe. Serological testing to detect antibodies will be performed on blood samples taken at month 0, 6, 12, 18 and 24 with additional time-points if bloodwork is available via normal clinical care. Clinical data on lung function, CF-related medical history, pulmonary exacerbations, antibiotic use, and microbiology and vaccination receipt, will be collected during routine clinical assessments.

Associations will be examined between socio-demographic and clinical variables and serologic testing. The effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on clinical outcomes and analyse end-points will be examined to explore any age-related or gender-based differences, as well as subgroup analysis of outcomes in lung-transplant recipients and pwCF receiving CFTR modulator therapies.

This has led to it being licensed for use in the UK in 2022 and is now being prescribed in this age group. There is little information in trials however that shows the effect KaftrioTM (ETI) has on the gut or liver in this age group.

Previous studies in the GIFT-CF series (NCT 03566550, NCT04006873 and NCT04618185) has found differences in the functioning of the gut between adults with CF and healthy controls but it is not known whether these differences are present in those aged 6 to 11 years.

This study is a significant amendment of the GIFT-CF3 protocol (NCT04618185) that aims to measure gut function using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in children with CF before and after starting ETI. This study also aims to opportunistically measure lung function and structure using MRI and explore how the liver can be measured using MRI in this age group.

The study is split into 2 stages. The first is a pilot stage using the modified GIFT-CF protocol recruiting 3 children with CF before starting ETI and 3 healthy volunteers. This is to determine we are able to successfully perform these scans in these age groups. If successful, the second stage will recruit a further 12 children with CF before they start ETI. This will take our cohort up to 15 children with CF. This cohort will then be rescanned 6 months after starting ETI using the same scan protocol., Gut Imaging for Function and Transit in Cystic Fibrosis 3 Junior: an Evaluation of Triple Combination Therapy in Children Aged 6 to 11 YearsElexacaftor / Ivacaftor / TezacaftorRecently trial data has shown that the medicine KaftrioTM (Elexacaftor/ Tezacaftor/ Ivacaftor) improves lung function in children aged 6 to 11 years who have cystic fibrosis (CF).
